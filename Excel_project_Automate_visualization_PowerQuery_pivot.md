### Problem Statement:

Consolidate from several files the visualization by clicking a  button to update the information. This activity will be completed by using Power Query and Power pivot for data modeling, those tools will enable us to generate the visualization for future decisions.

### First step: 

Automate Data gathering and Data cleaning or transform the data by using Power Query.
This process will start locating the files' , the data is obtained by clicking on “Get data” and then From File as shown in the following Figure 1.

### Figure 1

Once the data is obtained in the Power Query editor some format for date columns is changed, a column “Day_to_ship” and “Sales Amount” are added to the table and the connection is created to add the data model in Power Pivot, as shown in Figure 2 and Figure 3.

### Figure 2

Once the connections are done and the tables are added to the data model, Power Pivot shows us the tables to start creating the relationship between the tables as shown in the following Figure 4 and Figure 5.
### Figure 4

### Figure 5

#### Data Modelling: In this part the relationships between table are created to start building the insights in the dashboard as shown in the Figure 6 and Figure 7.
### Figure 6

### Data visualization: 
As show in the Figure 7, the dashboard enable us to track or monitor during a series time(by year) the shipping and sales of determined categories, having all the data connected.
